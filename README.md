# According to Naive Bayes

Bayes theorem is used to estimate the precision of values (given by 18th-century mathematician from Britain)
Features of a measurement are independent of each other
Features are mutually independent
# P (A/B) = {P. (A⋂B) / P. (B)} = { P (A) . P (B/A) / P (B)}

In this formula, according to Bayes Rule in Machine Learning –

P(A) denotes the probability of A event occurring

P(B) denotes the probability of B event occurring

P(A/B) denotes the probability of A by B

P (B/A) denotes the probability of B by A

P (A⋂B) denotes the probability of both A and B events occurring
